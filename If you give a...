If you give a *animal* a *food* it's going to ask for a *noun*. When you give it the *previous noun*, it will want to *verb*. When it is finished, it will *verb*. Then it will *verb* and *verb* to the *noun*. Since that doesn't work out, it will want to go to *location*. On the way, it will see a *noun* and will want *noun*. Then you will have to take it to the *location*. It will *verb*. When it is done, it'll ask you for some *food*. On the way home, it will start a game of *game*. When you finally get home, you'll have to *verb*. Then it'll want a *noun*. You'll have to find a *noun* and *plural noun*. When it sees the *previous noun*, it will start *verb ending in -ing*. Then it will *verb* out of *plural noun*. Of course when it is finished, it will want to *verb*. So, it will ask for a *first noun entered*. And chances are if you give it a *same noun*, it is going to want a *noun*.
